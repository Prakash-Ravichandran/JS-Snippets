    <h3>Reference Type</h3>

        /* Reference type is a special “intermediary” internal type, with the purpose to pass information from dot . to calling parentheses (). 

        /* Reading a property, such as with dot . in obj.method() returns not exactly the property value,
         but a special “reference type” value that stores both the property value and the object it was taken from. */

        /* Here we have a more complex call (expression)(). The call works as if it were split into two lines:

         f = obj.go; // calculate the expression
         f(); */

         // dot . operator has special internal property of refering the object to the method call() ,
         // has the right to assign this = object while calling a func(), 
         // that's why it is breaking if we put them into a two line statement or calling after a expression dynamically.


         let user = {
             name : 'sriram',
             hello(){
                 return console.log(`${this.name}`);
             }
         };
         let method;
         user.hello();  // here the dot operator has the special intermediary 'internal type ' for assigning this = user ,

         method = user.hello;  // here the dot operator loses its intermediary 'internal type' , so   . and () should be in same line;
         method();
