        //sometimes our scripts have errors. 

        // why we need try & catch  ?
        // 1. our mistakes 2.An unexpected user input. 3.An erroneous server response. 4.For a thousand other reasons.

        /* script execution stops if a single error is occured in a program .
        
        so using try...catch , whenever we feel a block of code will have the possibility of creating a error, there we can use try...catch 
        
        Note : 
        1. if any error : The execution of try block code stops where if any error has occured & then switches to catch block .
        2. If no error  : Catch block execution stopped.
        
        
        caution 1 : The JavaScript engine first reads the code, and then runs it:
                    errors occuring during reading are called as parste-time errors ,
                    if there is any parse time errors , they are unrecoverable - means catch block wont execute.That’s because the engine can’t understand the code.

                    ex-code: 

                    try {
                           {{{{{{{{{{{{
                        } catch (err) {
                        alert("The engine can't understand this code, it's invalid");
                        }  
        Note : So, try...catch can only handle errors that occur in valid code. Such errors are called “runtime errors” or, sometimes, “exceptions”.
        
         */

  // caution 2: try...catch works only in synchronous not for aynchronous code 
 // why ????? 
 // setTimeout is executed after the javascript engine went out of reading the code.

                try {
                console.log("before execution"); // only this line will execute
                setTimeout(function() {
                "Hello world";
                }, 1000);
                } catch (err) {
                alert( "won't work" );
                }
 // solution try... catch can be placed inside the setTimeout Block 

                setTimeout(function() {
                try {
                    noSuchVariable; // try...catch handles the error!
                } catch {
                    alert( "error is caught here!" );
                }
                }, 1000);

// Error Object 

               try{
                   console.info("third try catch block");
                     age;
               } 
               
               catch(err){
                   alert('you are in third catch block');
                  console.log(err.name);   // refer error
                  console.log(err.message);  // error defining 
                  console.log(err.stack);   // gives with combined
               }

 // practical example of try...catch 
 
 
              var json = '{"name":"kumar" , "age" : 45}';

              let badjson = '{ name }';

              try{
                  let jsonbad = JSON.parse(badjson);
                  alert("fourth try block -- practical json");
              }

              catch(err){
                  alert('you are in fourth catch - Enter Json is bad');
                  alert("we apologize for our error - please try once again");
                console.log(err.stack);
              }

 // There is situation where are left an error with try-block & catch block wont execute 
 
                var json2 = '{ "age": 30 }'; // incomplete data

                try {

                let user = JSON.parse(json2); // <-- no errors
                alert( user.name ); // no name!

                } catch (err) {
                alert( "doesn't execute" );
                }

// in the upper-code the catch block wont execute  - that's where comes the throw operator 


// --------------The Throw operator----------------------------------

// The operator generates an error & that where passed to err of catch block 


                let exampleObj = { name : "Askok"};

                try {
                         let user = exampleObj;
                         alert(`user age is ${user.age}`); // its an error but catch block wont execute without throw operator
                         throw new Error("age is not received");
                }
                catch(err){
                          
                    alert(`please recheck the ${exampleObj} object`);
                    console.log(err.message);
                }

// concept of rethrowing -------------------------------------------

// There maybe scenario where catch block can rethrow the errors that dont know what is the error is ....

// in the example in info.js there is no JsON error actaully , but statement in catch says a JSON is error.


// so .... Catch should only process errors that it knows and “rethrow” all others.

/* The “rethrowing” technique can be explained in more detail as:

Catch gets all errors.
In the catch (err) {...} block we analyze the error object err.
If we don’t know how to handle it, we do throw err. */


 // we can say catch to handle a specific error by using instance of operator . & throw back other errors , that are caught in another try..catch block

    var newName = {name : "Ramanatham"};

    try {
           let userId = newName.id ; // no id is there 
           throw new SyntaxError("no id : incomplete data");

        //    func();  // one more error
    }

    catch(err) {
            if(err instanceof SyntaxError){
                  console.log('rethrow catch block');
                  alert(err.message);
                  throw err;
            }
    }

    
function rethrow(){
    var newName2 = {name : "Ramanatham"};

    try {
           let userId = newName2.id ; // no id is there 
           throw new SyntaxError("no id : incomplete data");

           func();  // one more error
    }

    catch(err) {
            if(err instanceof SyntaxError){
                  console.log('rethrow catch block');
                  alert(err.message);
                  throw err;
            }
    }
}

                try {
                    rethrow();
                }
                catch(err){
                    console.log('last catch block');
                    alert("func error is caught here");
                }
                

// finally  

//The code has two ways of execution:

// 1.If you answer “Yes” to “Make an error?”, then try -> catch -> finally.
// 2 .If you say “No”, then try -> finally.
