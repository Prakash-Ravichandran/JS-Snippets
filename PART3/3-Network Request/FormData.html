        FormData objects can help with that. As you might have guessed, it’s the object to represent HTML form data. */

        /* If HTML form element is provided, it automatically captures its fields.

        The special thing about FormData is that network methods, such as fetch, can accept a FormData object as a body. It’s encoded and sent out with Content-Type: multipart/form-data.

        From the server point of view, that looks like a usual form submission. */
